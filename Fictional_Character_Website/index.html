    <!--About section-->
    <section id="About">
        <h3><u>About</u></h3>
        <p>Cloud Strife is the main protaganist of Final Fantasy 7. He is an ex-SOLDIER of the Shinra electric power
            comapny. After leaving Shinra he turned to work as a mercenary. Soon after turinging to mercenary work he is
            hired by an childhood friend to help out the radical environmental group known as Avalanche in their quest
            to take down Shinra, who powers the city of Midgar using Mako energy which is causing the land around Midgar
            to wither and die.</p>
    </section>

    <!--Skills Section-->
    <section class="altBackground" id="Skills/Knowledge">
        <h3><u>Knowledge/Skills</u></h3>
        <p>Being an ex-SOLDIER Cloud is quite experienced in the field of combat. He is trained for many years to get to
            the point that he is at. Being an ex-SOLDIER of Shinra he has more knowledge of how they operate compared to
            the average person. This knowledge comes in handy when he is helping Avalanche take down Shinra providing
            them with knowlege they would not normally have.</p>
    </section>

    <!--Personality Section-->
    <section id="Personality">
        <h3><u>Personality</u></h3>
        <img src="Photos/CloudArmsCrossed.jpg" alt="Cloud with is arms crossed">
        <p>When first meeting people Cloud tends to treat them in a somewhat cold manner. He is distant, and very rarely
            volenteers any information about himself without a heavy amount of prompting from his closest friends. When
            asked about himself Cloud only ever talks about how he used to be a SOLDIER and treats that like it is his
            personality. However, below the frosty exterior he is a very complex individual. Cloud could be described as
            someone who struggles with self confidence, and he works hard to try to hide it under a tough guy persona,
            but under that persona is a guy who cares very deeply about his friends, and is willing to go to great
            lengths to try to help them in any way he can.</p>
    </section>

    <!--Associates Section-->
    <section class="altBackground" id="Associates">
        <h3><u>Associates</u></h3>
        <p>Cloud interacts with many people both friend and foe throughout his journey. However, the people that Cloud interacts with can be split into three main catagories.</p>
    </section>

    <section class="altImage">
        <h3><u>Friends</u></h3>

        alt="members of Avalanche Biggs, Jessie, and Wedge">
        <p>The first group of friends that Cloud makes are three of the members of Avalanche Biggs, Wedge, and Jessie. Cloud meets them when he begins his first misson for Avalanche.</p>

        alt="All the party members of final fantasy seven">
        <p>There are a number of people that will join Cloud on his journey to take down Sephiroth. The first two are Barret and Tifa. Barret being the leader of the Avalanche group that Cloud is helping, and Tifa being a childhood friend of Cloud's, and the person that convinced him to come and work for Avalanche. While in Midgar Cloud meets Aerith a flower girl who is the last living member of the Cetra.The final party member that Cloud meets in Midgar is RedXIII, a dog like creature being experimented on by Shinra. While adventuring through the woods Cloud can meet a girl named Yuffie a materia thief who will join the group if Cloud is able to convince her. Next Cloud can meet Cait Sith while in the Gold Saucer. In his hometown of Nibelheim Cloud can meet a man name Vincent Valentine. Finally while in a place called Rocket Town Cloud can meet a man by the name of Cid.</p>

        <h3><u>Enemies</u></h3>
        <img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/c/c4/Sephiroth.png"
            alt="Final Fantasy seven main antagonist Sephiroth">
        <p>The main enemy that Cloud must contend with is Sephiroth. A war hero who was thought to be dead, and the person that inspired Cloud to become a soldier when he was a child.</p>

        <p>Then there is the Shinra Electric Power Company who rules over the city of Midgar. Cloud is hired by Avalanch to help them take down Shinra. This leads Cloud to start having encounters with the Turks, a special forces like group that carries out much of Shinra's dirty work</p>
